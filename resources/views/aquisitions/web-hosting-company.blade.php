<h3><strong>Do You Want to Sell Your Web Hosting company? Here are the steps to do so with Marketorix Media</strong></h3>
<p>By following the six steps below, selling your web hosting agency to Marketorix Media is quick and simple.</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get in Touch</strong></li>
</ol>

<br>

<p>When you choose to sell your web hosting company, you want to know who your business is being sold to – after all, you built up an incredible business and want to know it’ll be taken care of. That’s why we don’t use brokers. You will be dealing with us directly, so please don’t hesitate to contact us directly today. As you will be working directly with us, you won’t have to pay a brokerage fee. All profits will be yours and yours alone!</p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>We Contact You</strong></li>
</ol>

<br>
<p>Once we have received your information, we will be in touch promptly to let you know if we are interested. When contacting us, please provide as much information as possible about your business – no detail is too small! Ensure you provide annual turnover, the reason for selling, and a general description of your business.</p>

<br>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>We Sign an NDA</strong></li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>If we’re interested in your web hosting agency, we will sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). By doing so, you can provide us with more financial and legal information, safe in the knowledge that whatever you tell us will stay confidential. However, the signing of the NDA does not demonstrate intent to purchase your web hosting agency. Still, it does allow us to share confidential information safely and securely, which could lead to purchase.</p>


<br>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>You Send Us Legal & Financial Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>The next step is to provide us with as much financial and legal information about your business to determine the health of your business. Such information we require includes annual reports submitted to Companies House, information on customers, products and services, assets, suppliers, and staff. As stated above, the NDA will ensure all information is kept strictly between us. We will also require bank statements and any outstanding creditors or tax liabilities. Additionally, we need to know more about the legal position of your business. The legal information we need includes any contracts you have with suppliers and the ownership of the company, such as major shareholders and their percentages.</p>

<br>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>You Receive an Offer</strong></li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>If after the 1st four steps are complete and we would like to acquire your business, we will send you an indicative offer and deal structure.

</p>

<br>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Business Acquisition Offer Approval & Acquisition Completion</strong></li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>When and if you approve the offer, we move quickly! You can rest assured knowing our professional team will continue your hard work. Your legacy, barand and personnel will be in good hands!
